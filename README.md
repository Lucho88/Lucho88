- 👋 Hi, I’m @Lachezar
- 👀 I’m interested in AWS Cloud Computing
- 🌱 I’m currently doing an AWS re/Start course which is covering several AWS services and many other subjects such as Linux, Networking, 
-  Security, Python and SQL. I also have some Java experience having built a small Android weather app.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any cloud related projects so I can build a portfolio and gain hands on experience.
